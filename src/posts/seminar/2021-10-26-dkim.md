We consider a random walk on the $d\ge 3$ dimensional discrete torus starting from vertices chosen independently and uniformly at random. In this talk, we discuss the fluctuation behavior of the size of the range of the random walk trajectories at a time proportional to the size of the torus. The proof relies on a refined analysis of tail estimates for hitting time. We also discuss related results and open problems.
