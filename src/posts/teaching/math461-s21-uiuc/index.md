- Prerequisite: Math 241 or the equivalent. We will use important topics from calculus, such as infinite series with positive terms (most calculations involve the geometric series and series derived from it), improper integrals and double integrals (change of variables formula, manipulating Gaussian integrals).

## Grading policy
- HW: 20% (weekly, the lowest one HW will be dropped.)
- Online quizzes: 20% (biweekly, in class, the loewst one quiz will be dropped.)
- Midterms: 15% and 20% (tentatively Mar 10 and Apr 21, in class, the lower exam score will be 15% and the other 20%.)
- Final: 25%
