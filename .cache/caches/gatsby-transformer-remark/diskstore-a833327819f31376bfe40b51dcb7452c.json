As one example of an application of our theorem, we discuss a Feynman-Kac type formula, showing that the solution to a second order linear ODE (or system of ODEs) is the mode of a particular diffusion. Our portmanteau theorem along with our Feynman-Kac result provides numerics and insight for solving these ODEs. Joint work with William Haskell and Harsha Honnappa. </p>"}
