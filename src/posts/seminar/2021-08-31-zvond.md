In this talk I will present some results on semilinear problems in general bounded open sets for non-local operators with exterior and boundary conditions. The operators are more general than the fractional Laplacian. I will also give results in case of bounded $C^{1,1}$ open sets. Joint work with I. Biocic (Biov{c}i\'c) and V.Wagner.
