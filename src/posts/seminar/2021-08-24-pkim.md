It is well known that Nash-type inequalities for symmetric Dirichlet forms are equivalent to on-diagonal heat kernel upper bounds for the associated symmetric Markov semigroups. In this talk, we discuss the equivalence among these and  off-diagonal heat kernel upper bounds under some mild assumptions. Our approach is based on a new generalized  Davies' method. This talk is based on a joint work with Zhen-Qing Chen, Takashi Kumagai and Jian Wang.
