In this talk, we discuss the equivalence among these and  off-diagonal heat kernel upper bounds under some mild assumptions. Our approach is based on a new generalized  Davies' method. This talk is based on a joint work with Zhen-Qing Chen, Takashi Kumagai and Jian Wang.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":450,"offset":450},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":450,"offset":450},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":451}}}}
